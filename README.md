# Recruitment task for front-end internship candidates

Convert the provided PSD file into a web page following the guidelines below.
## Non-functional requirements
- Focus on modern browsers (latest Chrome/Firefox).
- Remember about responsiveness.
- Remember about correct typography ([Montserrat font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)).
- In order to get you up to speed, we prepared a simple project boilerplate in the `task` folder. We encourage you to use it.
- We suggest not using any JavaScript frameworks such as React or Vue. If you want to use them, please provide us a short explanation as to why you decided to do it.
- On the other hand, we encourage using CSS pre or post processor and an automation tool of your choice. You can use what we already provided in the project boilerplate: SCSS and webpack.
## Functional requirements
- Upon page load, request should be made to `http://www.splashbase.co/api/v1/images/search?query=tree`. Results should be displayed accordingly to the designs.
- Show more button should show additional items.
- Filters at the top of the page should allow to filter out images coming from selected sites.
- If you are not sure as to some requirements, use your best guess.
- If some parts of the design are too complex, please implement as much as you can.

## Project boilerplate
Run `npm install` in the `task` folder to install dependencies. Available scripts:

- `npm run start` - watching for changes in SCSS and JS files and recompiling output files upon changes
- `npm run build` - compiling SCSS and JS source files
